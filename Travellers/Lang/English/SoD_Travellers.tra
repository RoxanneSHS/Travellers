@800= ~So we meet again, friend. I have heard of my brother's death a while ago at the hand of some hero of the Sword Coast. Were you involved in Davaeorn's end?~
@801= ~Lower your voice, man, those around need not to know my identity. Why are you here on their side?~
@802= ~It seems like you made a wrong choice again. The crusade is not fighting for a good cause. They will fall before me just like your brother did. Leave here before it gets too late.~
@803= ~I had to kill Davaeorn, that is true. He left me no choice. Nor does the Shining Lady. Nor anyone who tries to stand between me and her.~
@804= ~I'm not on any side here, <CHARNAME> - yes, I know by now who you are. I provide my healing skills to the wounded of either side. Their cause and politics are not my concern.~
