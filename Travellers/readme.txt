Travellers in Faerun

The mod tries to make EET even more of ONE story.
- it brings some non-joinable NPCs and a foreshadow of their story from BG2/ToB to earlier parts of the game.
- you can influence some later chapter events by decisions you make early (continuity in EET)
- you can go back with items you find later in the game to finish quests in BG1 or SoD
- you get quests for which you need to return to the BG1/SoD areas from later parts

Five episodes are there for trial already

SPOILER
- meet Valygar hunted by cowls in Larswood or Peldvale (you can help him or betray him
- meet Samia near the excavation site when you find the idol (if you sell it to her you can find it later in Firkraag's maze and finish the BG1 quest)
- Sir Sarles and Prism (extra variation if Safana is in party)
- The barmaid and the vampire is the first larger quest. It starts in Ulgoth's Beard and covers the initial quest and a sequel in Amn that requires a return to the BG1 areas. Various solutions are offered for roleplaying.

Component Arkanis Gath's Investigation
This is an optional quest, left to user's inclusion because it impacts the main story (without changing it though). Renal and his guild are alarmed by the time the player reaches Amn. Before you can meet Renal you have to proof yourself to Arkanis Gath. The quest involves a trip back to BG1/SoD areas. After you finished the task, the doors to the guild in the docks are open and all related content is available as normal (or expanded by other mods).
Note - travelling back to BG1/SoD may be used as an exploit to pick up items you may have put into some container in any of the already visited area...
