Travellers in Faerun

The mod tries to make EET even more of ONE story.
- it brings some non-joinable NPCs and a foreshadow of their story from BG2/ToB to earlier parts of the game.
- you can influence some later chapter events by decisions you make early (continuity in EET)
- you can go back with items you find later in the game to finish quests in BG1 or SoD
- you get quests for which you need to return to the BG1/SoD areas from later parts

Two episodes are there for trial already

SPOILER
- meet Valygar hunted by cowls in Larswood or Peldvale (you can help him or betray him
- meet Samia near the excavation site when you find the idol (if you sell it to her you can find it later in Firkraag's maze and finish the BG1 quest)
